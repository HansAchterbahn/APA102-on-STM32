 *
 *	\version 0.8	Initial release for the HACOX project team for code review
 *	\version 0.9	Added: Feature to decrease the number of frame updates transmitted over SPI.
 *	                       Every change of the frame buffer will set _frameModified to true to
 *	                       allow update of the LEDs.
 *	                       To allow force of update the update() function can now be forced to
 *	                       update when set to true.
